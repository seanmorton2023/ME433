i2c debug notes

- sda is low when data isn't being sent
- first and last waveform on SCL look odd
- weird blip on the SDA line before a 0x00 is 
	sent on it - I think this is the "turn off LED" 
	command, but it's not getting turned off
	
- write command is specified as "0x20" - check if this is
	the same as 0b0100 0000
		--> no, it's 0b0010 0000

- the system alternates between sending 0x80 (0b1000 0000) and 0x00 as the data
	written to the OLAT register
		
		
questions for Nick:
- should SDA be low when data is not being sent?
- the opcode&write command being sent is 0b0010 0000, but I want
	it to be 0b0100 0000. why is it doing that? is the data delayed
	somehow?
- is the timing strange for my system? it seems like the time between
	the 1st and second writes is very small
- restart bits: in between sequential reads, the datasheet made it seem
	like if we send a restart bit, that can take the place of the stop
	and start bits. is that the case, or do I need to send a restart bit and
	another bit to go along with it?
