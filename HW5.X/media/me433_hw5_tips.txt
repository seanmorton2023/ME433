//make the 2 8-bit numbers for spi_io

//send the first (high) 8-bit num from the 16-bit num. (see endianness))
//bit-shift the 16-bit num to just grab 8 bits, t >>>8

//send the last (low) 8-bit num from the 16-bit number.
//use bitwise AND with 0xFF (0b0000000011111111)) to get these 8 bits

//re/ asst: make the update rate of the DAC 200x faster, rather
//than 50x

//on a scope, verify you see the stuff from SPI before even wiring
//up the DAC chip. do things modularly
