ME433 notes 4-11-23

- from schematic editor: tools -> assign footprints
- on left side click on libraries of footprints
- on right side, right click on options to view package
- resistors: 7.62mm length resistors; horizontal.
	- 0.3in spacing (3 holes on a breadboard)
- PIC: Package-DIP library
- Can use footprint filters to find the one you're looking 
	for. EX: socket long pads 7.62mm
- AP7381: TO- THT package. TO-92 Inline
- caps:
	- 0.1 in spacing for 10uF ones we have
	- 0.2in spacing for 1uF ones we have
	- use "disc p2.50mm" for search filters
- EG1218 switch; make from scratch
- to get schematic into the PCB:
	- hit the green "open PCB in board editor" button in the schematic view
	- hit the gray+green "update PCB with schematic changes" button
	- press ok inside the menu
- fun fact: if you want the manufacturer to solder your stuff,
	they want all chips/things of the same type to be in the same
	orientation. we should try to follow this practice too
- use "edge cuts" to define the shape of our PCB

- constraints on traces:
	- minimum size from manufacturer is 6 thou (= 0.15mm)
	- 1mm is probably too thick
	- use 0.4mm (Nick recommends)
	- power and ground traces are complicated; make the 5V traces that go to VDD5V0
		thicker as they'll have high current to the H bridges
- Ground plane: do "filled area" rather than rectangle or routing tool
	- he says we could do this on only one plane - he does the bottom
	- I'm gonna trust Ilya and do both bottom and top plane
	
_______

done:
- ask about mounting holes for the PCB
- "B" to do "zone fills" - essentially like "ratsnest" in Eagle
- check if there's a command like "ripup @ ;" to remove
	visibility of the zone fills
- recommends adding extra power and ground holes to touch w/ scope


to-do for ME433 PCB:
- check connections for the G+Y LEDs
- recommends printing out our PCB schematic on a 1:1 piece of paper
	to see if components will fit
- compare my schematic w/ Nick's and look for differences
- put headers in desired locations
- ask if location of pins on headers matters; I have B6 at bottom
	for convenience
- check orientation of LEDs on PCB layout - ie which polarized
	side goes on the side with the flat edge
