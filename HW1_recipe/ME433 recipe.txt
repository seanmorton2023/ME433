Ingredients:

2 cups of PIC32MX795F512H chips
1 pound of fish (your choice of type)
1 cup of flour
1 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of baking powder
1 cup of beer (optional, for the batter)
Oil for frying
Directions:

First, clean and dry your fish, then cut it into bite-sized pieces.
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
If you're using beer, slowly pour it into the bowl while stirring until a smooth batter forms. If not, add enough water to create a thick batter.
Dip each piece of fish into the batter, coating it completely, then gently shake off any excess.
Take your PIC32 microcontroller chips and scatter them in the oil for frying. Watch out, they may be small but they can get hot!
Once the oil is hot, carefully add the battered fish and the PIC32 chips into the frying pan, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
Fry until the batter is golden brown and crispy, and the fish is cooked through.
Remove the fish and chips from the pan with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to soak up any excess oil.
Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce (may we suggest a nice, cooling aioli to offset the heat of those PIC32 chips?)
